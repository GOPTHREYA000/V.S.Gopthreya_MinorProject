# Quantum-Inspired Digital Watermarking for Forensic Evidence Authentication Using BB84 QKD

## 📌 About the Project
This project proposes a quantum-inspired digital watermarking framework for forensic evidence authentication, leveraging principles from the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. The primary objective is to ensure integrity, authenticity, and tamper detection of sensitive digital forensic evidence such as images, videos, or documents.
By integrating quantum cryptographic concepts with classical digital watermarking, the system introduces a novel, forward-looking approach to combating evidence manipulation, unauthorized access, and replay attacks in digital forensics.
